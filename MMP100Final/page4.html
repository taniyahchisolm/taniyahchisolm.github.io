        <p> Cheebis: "Woah! Wormy! You got me a whole christmas tree for outside! You know how much I love Christmas! Thank you.
            Wormy: *nods* 
            Cheebis: "All I got you was this box b-"
            Wormy seems to be absolutely enamoured with the box! He wiggles slightly before speaking for once!
            Wormy: "Christmas isn't just about giving. Your company is enough too, Cheebis." 
            Cheebis seems quite excited with this response! He can't wait to spend the rest of the day with Wormy! Whether or not he talks!
